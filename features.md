## Personal Note

While this is not my best work, I'm really glad to have had the opportunity. Initially, I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn Angular. This turned out not to be the best project to use as a launching point to learn Angular.

I decided on Friday morning, far too late in the game, to use Vue instead. I used the Nuxt framework and eventually decided on using the Vuetify UI Framework. I'm happy with those choices as I was more quickly getting better results.

Regardless of the outcome, this was a great experience and I have learned a lot that will be usefull in the future and in useless triva games.

Did you know the city of Chicago has ~500 different categories of food serving facilities? Blockbuster Video, for example.

Also, I didn't properly follow instructions regarding the pull request. I see now that I should have been working on a `{working-branch}` instead of multiple branches and merging into main.

Thank so much and talk soon!
