# clean-eats

This app intends to help you to quickly find out if the restaurant you are about to eat at has passed inspection.

## Some prerequisites...

1. You'll want to be sure to have [node](https://nodejs.org/).
   Nuxt requires version 10.13 at least.
2. A text editor. Both I and the Nuxt team recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. A terminal. VS Code has a great [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal).
4. Maybe you've suddenly been forced to or have always used a PC. Check out [Windows Subsystem For Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Even Microsoft reccomends it for web Node.js development.

Grab the code here:

```bash

```

## Build Setup

Once you've downloaded it, `cd` into the directory you installed the project in and run
the following commands.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
